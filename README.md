# MalmoRL
A framework for training Reinforcement Learning agents in Minecraft with [Project Malmö](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo). I've build it for my own research and I hope it's useful for you as well. It is partially based on code provided with the [The Malmo Collaborative AI Challenge](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo-challenge), extended to support more Malmö mission environments. It should also be easy to extend further to support the needs of your environment.
